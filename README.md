# Sample trademark extension


 **Please check off when finished:**

 - [ ] implement check if user has inputted license key and unhide elements on myscript.js if they are authenticated

 - [ ] implement  check if user has inputted license key on foreground.js . This
       should be possible if state has been implemented to store the
       license key properly.


Requirements of the project:

 - Integrate Gumroad API to check for customer's license status
 - Extension will store user's license key and not ask for it every time
   they open the extension. The stored license key needs to be retrievable on at least these files,  myscript.js and  foreground.js
